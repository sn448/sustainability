            <p class="intro">Being a college student is hard enough, and a lot of people dont have time to worry about the planet on top of classes.
                However, going green as a college student can not only save the planet, it can also save your wallet because a lot of eco-friendly tips can double as money saving tips.
                Here are a few quick, easy, and affordable tips to lower your carbon footprint while in college without having to make major lifestyle changes.
            </p>
            <ol class="tips">
                <li><h5>Take notes electronically to reduce waste.</h5>
                    The average american uses seven trees and 680 pounds of paper per year.
                    Taking notes electronically whenever possible can significantly bring down that number and reduce the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere.
                    To save even more, buy used textbooks rather than new ones, or try to find a pdf online.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Get a reusable water bottle and take it with you everywhere</h5>
                    It is estimated that 80% of water bottles in the US never get recycled.
                    And, it takes three times the amount of water that's in a water bottle to produce one!</li>
                <li><h5>Get a reusable coffee mug</h5>
                    Coffee is a staple for all college students, but this can produce a lot of waste.
                    Instead of using a new paper/plastic mug everytime you need a boost of energy, get a reusable one instead!
                </li>
                <li><h5>Say no to plastic bags</h5>
                    Bring your own reuasable bag whenever your go shopping.
                    Similarly, look for products with less packaging to reduce the amount of trash going into landfills.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Walk or bike more</h5>
                    In addition to saving the environment, this will help you adopt a healthier lifestyle and save on gas money!
                </li>
                <li><h5>Become a smart shopper</h5>
                    Support better brands.
                    <br><b>Cleaning products:</b>
                    Look for beauty and cleaning products that are ecofriendly and source their products responsibly.
                    <br><b>Appliances:</b>
                    When looking to buy a new appliance, look for the EnergyStar label. This tells you that the appliance saves energy.
                    Also avoid products that contain CFCs, which destroy the ozone layer.
                    <br><b>Clothing:</b>
                    Environmentally-conscious clothing lines are usually on the more expensive side and may not be affordable for college students, but there are still ways you can wear clothing that are friendly to they environment.
                    The #30wears campaign encourages buyers to make more environmentally friendly choices.
                    If you cant see yourself wearing something 30 times, dont buy it.
                    You can also buy clothing and other household goods second hand, to cut down on use of new resources in production.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Donate the things you dont need</h5>
                    Donate your unwanted furniture, appliances, and clothing so that they may be reused.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Use an LED desklight</h5>
                    LED lights are more expensive, but they last much longer than incandescent and CFL bulbs.
                    This way, you can go years without having to buy more bulbs (less waste)
                </li>
                <li><h5>Unplug</h5>
                    It is estimated that the average college student brings 5 electronic devices with them.
                    Unplugging these whenever they are not in use is a good habit to get into and can save a lot of energy.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Recycle</h5>
                    The average college student produces 640 pounds of solid waste each year, including 500 disposable cups and 320 pounds of paper.
                    Recycling and composting force you to think about where you are putting your trash and how much of it you actually produce.
                    <br>Most colleges and universities have a recycling program in place on campus.
                    Find out whether your college campus - or your city, if you are living off campus - uses single stream recycling , or a system that requires you to sort plastics before depositing it in the bin.
                    Take the time to what can and canâ€™t be recycled.</li>
                <li><h5>Start composting</h5>
                    Composting is a great way to dispose of your food waste in an environmentally responsible way, and it is also great for your garden.
                    Composting initiatives are also spreading on college campuses.
                    Find out how your school handles leftover food waste.
                    If you are living at home, you can buy a compost bin and make your own compost at home.
                    Many cities also collect food and leaves for composting, so that could be a great option to look into if you dont feel ready to start an at-home compost.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Join a club</h5>
                    Most college campuses have green clubs that help organize sustainability education initiatives.
                    Look for one at your school. Or, if there isnt one, start one yourself!
